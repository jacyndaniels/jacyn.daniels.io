  <h2>The Office</h2>
  <p>The Office is my all time favorite show. My favorite characters on it are Jim, Dwight, and Stanley I think Michael is so annoying and so is Pam. Each
    episode is unique in that it sometimes it doesn't have a plot and therefore it's kinda random.
    The humor is kind of dry which I like. It never fails to make me laugh and
    I hope they revive the show. You can find it on Netflix!</p>

  <h2>The Vampire Diaries</h2>
  <p> The Vampire Diaries was a good show. It's action packed and kind of a love story so if you're into that this is good for you.
    It's also on Netflix and it's TV program is the CW.

<h2>Young Justice</h2>
  <p> Young Justice is one of my go to shows because I love animation and I absolutely love super heros. Not only does it feature super heros from the
    Justice League but the main focus is on the teenage super heros that handle covert and operations that the League can't do because they are too well known.
    Characters include, Robin, Aqualad, Speedy, Blue Beetle, Wondergirl, and Batgirl. Love it.
